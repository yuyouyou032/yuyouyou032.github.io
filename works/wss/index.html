                            Rhys subverts the concept of Victorian feminism,
                            transcending over the timed conventions. <br>
                            She highlights the power of femininity,
                            offering an alternative to empowering females
                            other than living up to masculine standards and possessing certain masculine traits. <br>
                            Hence, Wide Sargasso Sea offers an alternative that is inherently feminist,
                            making use of the powers naturally present in females. <br>
                            Antoinette breaks free from not only the oppression
                            of a patriarchal, imperialistic society,
                            but also the narrative created in Charlotte Brontë’s cardboard box.

                    <p class="description">Youyou, Xinyue, you have picked out two very appropriate texts for a very rich topic of analysis! 
                        I enjoyed the focus on feminism characterized in the lens of post-colonialism. 
                        I think there is room for you to make closer comparisons with Jane Eyre since 
                        the proposal looks like it is skewed more towards Wide Sargasso Sea and Antoinette for now, 
                        and to think about how the reader of your research can also think about the differences 
                        between the two texts and how these ruptures or differences inform the idea of female subordination, 
                        identity, and imperialism. </p>
