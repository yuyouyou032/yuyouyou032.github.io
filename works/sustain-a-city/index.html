            <p class="description-short">Supervision during the recycling process, as well as creating convenience and incentives for people to recycle, are both of paramount importance.

                    <h2 class="sub-title">Summary</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        We propose a system including an app guiding recycling, 
                        an auto-classifying dustbin that computes whether it should open its lid based on the category of the trash,
                        and a mass auto-recycling line at waste treatment facilities. All three are powered by our CV model.<br>
                        <br>
                        We built our dustbin prototype from scratch. For our prototype, 
                        we have made use of a Raspberry Pi model 4B with 4GB RAM, 
                        which can be swapped out for a cheaper microcontroller ($25) for the actual product, 
                        a USB camera ($3), a motor ($5), breadboard ($2) and a pulley (<$1) to ensure the string does not snap easily. The total cost of production is below $40, 
                        which is a reasonable price for upgrading a recycling bin that costs more than $400.<br>
                        <br>

                        Lightweight and highly accurate, our model can be easily mounted to robots or mobile devices.  
                        The model can eventually be integrated into advanced waste management plants to facilitate automatic sorting and analysis. 
                        This integration, therefore, tackles three problems present at different waste management stages
                         â€“ insufficient public awareness and knowledge about recycling, recycle bin contamination, and low efficiency of manual waste sorting in waste treatment plants. <br>

                        As 1st runner-up of the competition, we won a learning trip to Finland. Yay.
